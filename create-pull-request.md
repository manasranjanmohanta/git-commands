# How to Create a Pull Request

## Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Go to the repository you want to contribute to on the platform (e.g., GitHub).
2. Click on the "Fork" button to create a copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

## Step 2: Clone the Forked Repository
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git`.
3. If you want to clone a specific branch of a repository instead of the default branch (usually main or master) `git clone -b branch-name https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
`

## Step 3: Create a New Branch
1. Navigate to the cloned repository: `cd repository-name`.
2. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b branch-name`.

## Step 4: Make Changes
1. Make your desired changes to the codebase using a text editor or an IDE.
2. Stage your changes: `git add .`.
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Your commit message here"`.

## Step 5: Push Changes to Your Fork
1. Push the changes to your forked repository: `git push origin branch-name`.

## Step 6: Create a Pull Request
1. Go to your forked repository on the platform (e.g., GitHub).
2. You should see a prompt to create a pull request for the branch you just pushed.
3. Click on "Compare & pull request."
4. Add a title and description for your pull request, explaining what changes you made.
5. Review the changes and ensure everything looks good.
6. Click on "Create pull request" to submit it.

## Step 7: Review and Collaborate
1. The project maintainers or collaborators will review your pull request.
2. They may ask for changes or provide feedback.
3. Make any necessary updates by committing and pushing changes to your branch.
4. The pull request will automatically update with your new commits.
5. Once approved, the pull request will be merged into the main branch of the original repository.
